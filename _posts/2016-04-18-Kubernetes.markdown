I started playing around with Kubernetes today. I first followed the [AWS guide](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/aws/) and had the thing up in 10 minutes! I was shocked, really. 

I played around with it on AWS for about an hour before turning it off and going with the local version (I'm a cheapskate like this). 

I'll be writing a very simple app to try out service discovery, health checking, and a generally just loosing myself for more meaningful application development. Stay tuned!
